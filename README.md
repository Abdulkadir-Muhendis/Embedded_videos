# Embedded videos on STM32
This repository holds code and other files that are used for each video. Check out the video for explanation. I am making these videos with STM32f4DISCOVERY board with STM32f407IG processor. Most, if not all, functions that I explain in the videos can be implemented on other STM32 processors with variations in ram and rom size and selection of perifery on each processor. Make sure to always check datasheet and reference manual to confirm compatability. 

## Note for early videos with standard library
I have also added a template folder with all files needed besides the library, that you should download and store separate for the first videos that use standart library.
It is also expected (explained all in VIDEO 1) that you have ARM GCC compiler installed, st-link utility and stlib from ST somewhere on your drive. I recommend in a folder on your /HOME.
