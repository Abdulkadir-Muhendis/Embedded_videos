## My STM32CubeIde settings
STM32CubeIde is based on eclipse, therefore most settings work on other eclipse based IDEs. 

My IDE theme is called Darkest Dark by DevStyle. You can install it yourself by going to Eclipse Marketplace. You can install only the theme or add the icon pack, like myself. After install the IDE will restart. On restart select dark theme (middle one).
To change syntax highlighting style, go to Preferences>DevStyle>Color Themes and Click browse button. It will take you to a webpage that has lots of different syntax themes. I used an IntelliJ based one (Darcula JetBrains) that is also included in this directory. When you download your theme, you can import it in ide by clicking Import button in Color Theme Dev Style Configurator. You can also see your Result in a preview window.
